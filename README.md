# `voltctl` - A command line tools to access VOLTHA
In today's VOLTHA implementation the operator interacts with VOLTHA via a CLI
that is accessed by `SSH`ing to the VOLTHA tool. While is can be convenent as
it requires not external tool to be installed it is an abirtation in terms of
industry trends for tools such as `docker` and `kubernetes`, which are both
tools that VOLTHA leverages.

This repository contains a tool that attempts to provide a use model for
VOLTHA that is similar to that of `docker` and `kubernetes` in that a simple
control application is provided to invoke various funcs and the output can
be displayed as a customized/filtered table or as `JSON`.

## Build / Install
To install the `voltctl` command you can use the following:
```bash
mkdir myworkdir
cd myworkdir
export GOPATH=$(pwd)
git clone http://github.com/ciena/voltctl src/github.com/ciena/voltctl
cd src/github.com/ciena/voltctl
make build
cp ./voltctl <to any place you want in your path>
```

`voltctl` has only been tested with `go` version 1.12.x.

## Shell Completion
`voltctl` supports shell completion for the `bash` shell. To enable
shell Completion you can use the following command on *most* \*nix based system.
```bash
source <(voltctl completion bash)
```

If this does not work on your system, as is the case with the standard
bash shell on MacOS, then you can try the following command:
```bash
source /dev/stdin <<<"$(voltctl completion bash)"
```

If you which to make `bash` shell completion automatic when you login to
your account you can append the output of `voltctl completion bash` to
your `$HOME/.bashrc`:
```bash
voltctl completion base >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

## Configuration
Currently the configuration only supports the specification of the VOLTHA
server. There is a sample configuration file name `voltctl.config`. You can
copy this to `~/.volt/config` and modify the server parameter to your
environment. Alternatively you can specify the server on the command line as
well, `voltctl -server host:port ...`.

## Commands
Currently only two commands are working
- `voltctl adapter list` - displays the installed adapters
- `voltctl device list` - displays the devices in the system
- `voltctl device create [-t type] [-i ipv4] [-m mac] [-H host_and_port]` -
  create or pre-provision a device
- `voltctl delete DEVICE_ID [DEVICE_ID...]` - delete one or more devices
- `voltctl enable DEVICE_ID [DEVICE_ID...]` - enable one or more devices
- `voltctl disable DEVICE_ID [DEVICE_ID...]` - disable one or more devices
- `voltctl version` - display the client and server version

## Output Format
Each command has a default output table format. This can be overriden from
the command line using the `voltctl --format=...` option. The specification
of the format is roughly equivalent to the `docker` or `kubectl` command. If
the prefix `table` is specified a table with headers will be displayed, else
each line will be output as specified.

The output of a command may also be written as `JSON` or `YAML` by using the
`--outputas` or `-o` command line option. Valid values for this options are
`table`, `json`, or `yaml`.
