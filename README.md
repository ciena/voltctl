![We've Moved](./resources/weve_moved.png "We've Moved")

The `voltctl` project has moved to be part of the Open Networking Foundation's (ONF)
VOLTHA project that is managed through the ONF's `gerrit` GIT server at
[`https://gerrit.opencord.org/#/admin/projects/voltctl`](https://gerrit.opencord.org/#/admin/projects/voltctl). The project will continue
to be available on `github.com` as the `gerrit` repository is mirrored to
[`https://github.com/opencord/voltctl`](https://github.com/opencord/voltctl).
